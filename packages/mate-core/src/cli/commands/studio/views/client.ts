 * Runs in `<head>` before first paint. A server-rendered document arrives with
 * its markup already in place, so a remembered appearance applied after load
 * would paint the other one first and then repaint, and a remembered companion
 * restored after load would paint the picker before leaving it.
 *
 * The restore names the companion in the URL and reloads, because the URL is
 * what the server answers. A companion parameter that is present and empty is
 * a deliberate "no companion" and is left alone, so the redirect cannot loop
 * and the picker stays reachable.
